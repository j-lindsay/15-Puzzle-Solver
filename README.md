# 8-Puzzle-Solver

A fullstack flask web-app that uses search algorithms to find the best paths for solving search algorimths. Calculating the evaluation path is handled on the backend using 
python, and user inputs and visualization is handled on the frontend, incorporating d3.js for display the solution path. The algorithms used are of both informed and uninformed
nature so the user may select whichever algorithm suits them best based on the configuration of their start and goal states.
